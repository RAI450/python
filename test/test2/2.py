# 2.Digit Threshold Break Analyzer

# A monitoring system analyzes numeric IDs to detect high-value digits. 
# The system keeps adding digits one by one, but stops processing as soon as the running sum exceeds a given threshold.

# Write a program to:

# Accept a number and a threshold value
# Traverse digits from right to left
# Keep adding digits to a running sum
# Display each digit added
# The moment sum exceeds the threshold, stop using break
# Display:
# - Digits processed
# - Final sum
# - Count of digits processed
# If threshold is never exceeded, print Threshold Not Reached

# Use loops and break wherever required.

# Input:
# 57294
# Threshold = 10

# Output:
# Digits Processed: 4 9
# Sum = 13
# Count = 2
# Threshold Exceeded

# Input:
# 1234
# Threshold = 15

# Output:
# Digits Processed: 4 3 2 1
# Sum = 10
# Count = 4
# Threshold Not Reached
