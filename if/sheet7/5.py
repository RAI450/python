# 5. Cinema Ticket Booking System


# A cinema hall charges ticket prices based on the age of the customer:

# * Children (below 12 years) → ₹100
# * Adults (12 to 60 years) → ₹200
# * Senior citizens (above 60 years) → ₹150

# Write a Python program to determine the ticket price.

# Input:
# Enter age: 10

# Output:
# Ticket Price: ₹100

age=int(input("enter age "))

if age<12:
    price=100
elif age<=60:
    price=200
else:
    price=150
 
print("Ticket Price: ",price)
