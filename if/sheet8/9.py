# 9. Multi-Level Employee Promotion System

# A company promotes employees based on experience, rating, projects completed, and salary.

# If experience is at least 5 years, then check rating. If rating is at least 4, then check projects. 
# If projects are at least 3, then check salary. If salary is up to 50000, promote with 30 percent hike; otherwise 20 percent hike. 
# If projects are less than 3, promote with 10 percent hike. If rating is below 4, no promotion. 
# If experience is less than 5, then check if rating is 5. If yes, fast track promotion; otherwise no promotion.

# Input:
# Experience = 6
# Rating = 4
# Projects = 2

# Output:
# Promotion Status = Promoted with 10% hike

rate=int(input("enter rating "))
