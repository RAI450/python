# 1. Adjacent Digit Difference Analyzer

# A system analyzes differences between consecutive digits in a number.

# Write a program to:

# Find the difference between every pair of adjacent digits
# Display all differences
# Count how many differences are even
# Find the largest difference
# If all differences are same → print Uniform Difference
# Else → print Non-Uniform Pattern

# Input:
# 84261

# Output:
# Differences: 4 2 4 5
# Even Differences Count = 3
# Max Difference = 5
# Non-Uniform Pattern
