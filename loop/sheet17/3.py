# 3. Digit Neighbor Sum Analyzer

# A system analyzes the relationship between a digit and its immediate neighbors.

# Write a program to:

# Traverse digits from left to right (ignore first and last digit)
# For each digit, calculate sum of its adjacent digits
# Check if current digit is equal to the sum of its neighbors
# Display such digits
# Count how many such digits exist
# If none found → print No Matching Digit
# Else → print Neighbor Sum Pattern Found

# Input:
# 121314

# Output:
# Matching Digits: 2 3        #only 2
# Count = 2
# Neighbor Sum Pattern Found
