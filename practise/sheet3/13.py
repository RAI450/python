# Assignment 13: Compound Interest Calculator

# Write a Python program that:

# Accepts principal, rate, and time.
# Calculates compound interest.

# Input:
# Principal = 1000
# Rate = 10
# Time = 2

# Output:
# Amount = 1210.0
# Compound Interest = 210.0

p,r,t=map(int,input("enter principal ,rate and time").split())
# ci=float(p(1+(r/100)t)-p)
# print("amount =",p+ci)
# print("compound intrest =",ci)

a=p(1+(r/100))^t
print(a)
