# Assignment 1: Time Converter
# ========================================

# An event management company is developing a scheduling system. One of the key tasks is converting the duration of events from total seconds (which their sensor system records) into a more human-readable format of hours, minutes, and seconds.

# Write a Python program that:
# - Accepts the total event duration in seconds as input.
# - Calculates how many hours, minutes, and seconds it corresponds to.
# - Displays the output in the format:
#   Hours: x, Minutes: y, Seconds: z

# Sample Input:
# Total event duration in seconds: 3672

# Sample Output:
# Hours: 1, Minutes: 1, Seconds: 12


sec=int(input("give total duration in seconds"))
hours=int(sec/3600)
mins=int((sec-(hours*3600))/60)
secs=int((sec-(3600*hours)-(60*mins)))
print("hours :",hours,",mins :",mins,",secs :",secs)
